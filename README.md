## Contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
Now, take a moment to be sure your contributions make sense to everyone else.

### Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Want a new feature? First of all see if your issue or idea has [already been reported](../../issues).
If it hasn't, just open a [new clear and descriptive issue](../../issues/new).

### Submitting pull requests

Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope, and do avoid unrelated commits.

> 💁 **Remember: size is the #1 priority.**
>
> Every byte counts! PR's can't be merged if they increase the output size much.

-   Fork it!
-   Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/peedo`
-   Navigate to the newly cloned directory: `cd peedo`
-   Create a new branch for the new feature: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
-   Install the tools necessary for development: `yarn`
-   Make your changes.
-   `yarn build` to verify your change doesn't increase output size.
-   `yarn test` to make sure your change doesn't break anything.
-   Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
-   Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
-   Submit a pull request with full remarks documenting your changes.
